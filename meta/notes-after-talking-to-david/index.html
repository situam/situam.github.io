  <div class="entry-content">
  <p>It starts from a fascination with soft fascinations - a richness in slowly-shifting subtlety and nuance, environments that offer restorative, not tiring, qualities (reference A.R.T.). and though promiment in visuals, also in sound - ambient sounds having noted influence on experience (reference proposals - emergence in slow-evolving soundscape, on minimalism, vertical time, masking, etc.). and wanting to experience this often and with a more or less active role.</p>
<p>(note to self) as an aside<br />
how to work with these in a real-time way? (it's hard to engage in processes that aren't real-time)<br />
how to build a system that works for me?<br />
how to organize recordings in a way that they can be easily returned to? to understand/retrieve/hear-again the recordings with context they were made in?<br />
how to develop a research working attitude</p>
<ul>
<li>website as a working space - since it easily supports changing environments, sharing</li>
<li>just start developing, trying, documenting everything</li>
<li>make a roadmap, a place to keep/document also ideas that come up along the way and plans for making them real</li>
</ul>
<p>The work is then about setting up containers and letting moments emerge. Meandering - in a physical sense, slowly changing environments, and stopping at the places in-between, mediating in real-time the experience with the immediate soundscape. Being, listening, playing, capturing, processing, and afterwards, of listening to recordings, is also real-time, then juxtaposed with a new time and place.</p>
<h3>Session Entry</h3>
<p>After a session, recordings are collected from field recorder and iphone into a folder, a script creates a session entry. This holds the recordings, offers annotation posibilities for time-based media (video/sound), and a place for text entry - insights, feedback, note to self, areas for improvement.</p>
<p>From here the relevant components can be moved to more suitable locations (under <a href="http://situ.am/plans">plans</a>, or further developed into <a href="http://situ.am/modules">modules</a>), but most importantly, the thoughts are recorded and collected in a place to be found again. to remember and remember to remember.</p>
